| Welcome to Monster Saku! |

This is a CLI-based game involving two monster Trainers,
THAT IS YOU, PLAYER!
that compete to-the-death utilizing 6 each (12 in to total) randomly selected monsters from an established pool of monsters.
Whoever's left with at least 1 monster still alive when the other player's had all of their monsters killed,
then they will be the WINNER!

| How to Play? |

Whenever you see a menu of options laid out to you, such as:

[1] Option 1
[2] Option 2
...
[XX] Option YY

Just input the number corresponding to the option that you want to select on the ('>>') prompt.
The game will then take that input and translate it to the action that each option represents.

Each player will take turn and each turn the player is free to choose whether to make their monster perform a move,
switch the current monster with another monster in their deck, or see certain infos about the game being played.

If a player chose to switch out their monster, that will be done first before any move from the other player's monster
is performed. If both players chose to move their monsters, whichever has the highest priority, if not then whichever's the fastest,
if not then any monster at random, will perform the move first.

Have fun! And remember, whenever a monster of yours dies, 

THEY ARE DEAD FOREVER...
HOPE YOU CAN SLEEP WELL KNOWING THEIR BLOODS ARE IN YOUR HANDS,
MURDERER!
