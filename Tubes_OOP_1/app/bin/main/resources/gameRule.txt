| Welcome to Monster Saku! |

This is a CLI-based game involving two monster Trainers,
THAT IS YOU, PLAYER!
that compete to-the-death utilizing 6 each (12 in to total) randomly selected monsters from an established pool of monsters.

| How to Play? |

Whenever you see a menu of options laid out to you, such as:

[1] Option 1
[2] Option 2
...
[XX] Option YY

Just input the number corresponding to the option that you want to select on the ('>>') prompt.
The game will then take that input and translate it to the action that each option represents.

Have fun! And remember, whenever a monster of yours die, 

THEY ARE DEAD FOREVER...
